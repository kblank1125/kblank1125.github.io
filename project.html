<h1> UK's Productivity Puzzle & Immigration </h1> <!--Blinking-->
<h2> Data Science Project by Cheuk Hin Fung</h2> <!-- Jumping-->

<p10> This project introduces the reader to the UK's productivity puzzle and shows how immigration would be 
  a suitable solution. 
</p10>

<br>
<hr>


<!--Part 1: Productivity puzzle-->
<p1>
  Productivity of a country is key for its success as it has impacts on firms and individuals on the long run.
  The UK's productivity puzzle indicates that UK's productivity has been flat-lining after the 2008 financial crisis.
  It is crucial to be aware of this issue as this plateau means that the living standards in the UK has not been improved
  and it is necessary to find potential causes and solutions.
  The chart below shows UK's productivity using Output per hour from 1970. <br> 
</p1>

<!-- Chart below shows productivity in the UK with slider so audience can interact can change the start point-->

<div class="chart" id="chart1">
  
  <script>
    var myChart1 = "chart_output_full.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart1', myChart1);
  </script>

</div>

<br> <!-- To put a line break between charts or paragraphs-->
<br>

<p2>
  In the chart below, one can see that the slope began to flat-line after the red vertical line (2008 crisis). 
   
</p2>

<!-- productivity chart focus on 2008-->

<div class="chart" id="chart2">
    
  <script>
    var myChart2 = "chart_output.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart2', myChart2);
    
  </script>


</div>

<br>
<br>

<p3>
  Comparing to the financial crisis in 2000, the effect of the 2008 crisis is much serious. In the chart below, 
  we can see that there is no long-term plateau after 2000 (red vertical line). 
</p3>


<!-- productivity chart focus on 2000-->

<div class="chart" id="chart3">
    
  <script>
    var myChart3 = "chart_output_2000.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart3', myChart3);
  </script>

</div>

<br>
<br>


<p4> This is what economists are interested about; There must be a reason for such plateau after 2008. 
  There are several factors: <ol>
    <li>Aftershocks from the 2008 financial crisis</li>
    <li>Changes in monetary and fiscal policies</li>
    <li>Slowing innovation</li>
  </ol>
  However, these have been critised by economists. One must note that the scarring effect is quite temporary as credit availability has been eased years later.
  In addition, many firms have been adapting new technology. These have led to a steeper but insignificant slope. 
  Therefore, economists are still looking for the major reason(s).
</p4>


<br>

<!--Part 2: Look at immigration as a solution to the puzzle-->
<p5>
  Similarly, economists are looking for solutions to this plateau of productivity. One solution they propose is the <p7> introduction of migrant workers</p7>. 
  In the chart below, we can see that UK's immigration level has generally increased since 2008 which suggests that the country 
  attracts many opportunities for investments and jobs which would, as a result, boost the economy. 
</p5>

<br>

<div class="chart" id="chart4">
    
  <script>
    var myChart4 = "chart_migration.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart4', myChart4);
  </script>

</div>
<!-- This is the only chart where I have to manually edit data since it came in an Excel file with description.-->
 
<br>
<br>

<p6>
  Although immigration level has increased, does it mean that they are actually boosting the economy? 
  Is it easy for migrants to look for jobs? To do so, we can look at the employment rate in the UK. 
</p6>

<div class="chart" id="chart5">
    
  <script>
    var myChart5 = "chart_employment.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart5', myChart5);
  </script>

</div>

<br>

<p8>
  We can see that in the recent year, UK's employment rate has been increasing and it is further supported in the next chart. 
  The employment level for non-UK citizen is also growing which means that more are working in the country, especially in the low paying jobs such as agricultural sector
  which are currently lacking workers.
</p8>

<!-- chart showing employment level of immigrants-->

<div class="chart" id="chart6">
    
  <script>
    var myChart6 = "chart_em_Non.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart6', myChart6);
  </script>

</div>

<br>
<br>

<p9>
  In conclusion, immigration can be a good solution to such dilemma but resolving it takes various more approaches which 
  requires changes in policies by both the governments and firms.

<p11> Notes: Data is sourced mainly from ONS using API's and CSV's which are quite simple and apt for creating 
  charts using JavaScript. Only simple data cleaning was needed filtering the time period wanted either using in-hand JSON code or 
  manaully using Excel. </p11>
